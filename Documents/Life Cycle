Life cycle Model
We chose Agile as it is a Suitibale to team work and a form that we are familiar with. It will also work well with our Weekly
wendsday stand ups. It will allow us to update our requirements as we go and iterate over versions of the project. Reasons 
for chosing this over other methods vary. We Didn't choose the spiral method as it seems very chaotic and daunting. The waterfall 
method seemed inaproprate as one of its advantages is "Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood."
and we have very little undertanding of what is ment by the final requirements geographic elements.
